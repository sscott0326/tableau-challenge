# tableau-challenge

For this tableau story, data was used from months January-May of 2019 and 2020. The purpose is to both get a sense of what "normal" activity should be like by analyzing the first 5 months of 2019 and to also draw a comparison to the first 5 months of 2020, which has been impacted by COVID-19.

City Official Requested Map

Data from 2019 only was used to create this map. Each station is designated by a marker. With increasing popularity, marker size grows larger and marker color darkens. The most popular stations can be identified as the largest and darkest circles on the map.
The most popular stations are located in the area most central to where the service is located, in midtown Manhattan. As distance increases from this area, stations become increasingly less popular. Lower Manhattan and the Upper East/West sides have less popularity than midtown Manhattan, and finally with the least popularity is the outskirts of the service area in Harlem, Queens, and Brooklyn.


Trip Duration Dashboard

The purpose of this dashboard is to uncover the underlying factors that lead to trip duration. First, the top stations for the start of a trip were graphed based on total trip duration. The top 11 stations are listed, and these stations are all in midtown Manhattan. Next, trip duration was graphed was graphed by month and usertype. This gives a sense of how trip patterns trend throughout the year as well as how subscription/customer rates change. In the colder months of January and February, the total trip duration is less than in the warmer months such as April and May. Also in the colder months, the ratio of Subscriber (annual accounts) vs. Customer (temporary pass holders) is much higher with a trip duration ratio of 16:1 in favor of Subscribers. In the warmer months such as May, the ratio is much lower, about 4:1 in favor of Subscribers. This could be due to the influx of tourists/visitors to NYC in warmer months and the lack thereof in the cold weather. Finally, trip duration was mapped as an average vs. the birth year of the user. As the user gets younger, average trip duration increases. The turning point is around a birth year of 1985, making the user age 34. Users at or above the age of 34 have an average trip duration ranging frmo about 750 to 850 seconds (12-14 minutes). Users aged younger than 34 have an increasingly longer average trip duration with a decrease in age (15-20 minutes).

COVID-19 Dashboard

The purpose of this dashboard is to compare the activity of the first 5 months of 2020 to that of 2019 to help discover the impact of COVID-19 on this bicycle service. As seen from the charts, there is a steep drop-off in service in April of 2020 when NYC was in lockdown from coronavirus. In comparison to the first 5 months of 2019, the total number of trips taken in 2020 is about 1 million less. Next is the comparison graph of top stations for # of trips taken in 2020 in comparison to their levels in 2019. As seen in the graph, the most popular station in both years is Pershing Square North, which saw a decrease in rides from over 200,000 in 2019 to 30,000 in 2020.
